# FloorPlan creator for ESPresenseIPS

This project has been created to make it easier to create floorplan for ESPresenseIPS by having a gui.
It offers snap to rooms for easy alignement, gives you mesures on each side of your cursor when on a wall.
This application is developped in HTML/JS/CSS, no libraries, Canvas power !

This project is a work in progress.

## What is planned.  
[ ] Better UI/UX.  
[ ] Zoom, Pan on the canvas.  
[ ] Ability to add esp32 in rooms and position them with precision.  
[ ] Export esp32 position from rooms to ESPresenseIPS yaml format.  
[ ] Have each esp32 bluetooth signal radius visible on plan to make sure you have at least 3 signals in each rooms. (will help determine where is the best place to put them ;)).  

## A little glimps
