#FloorPlan creator for ESPresenseIPS

This project has been created to make it easier to create floorplan for ESPresenseIPS by having a gui.
This application is developped in HTML/JS/CSS, no libraries.

##What is planned
[] Better design
[] Ability to add esp32 in rooms and position them with precision
[] Export esp32 position from rooms to ESPresenseIPS yaml format
[] Have each esp32 bluetooth signal radius visible on plan to make sure you have at least 3 signals in each rooms. (will help determine where is the best place to put them ;))
